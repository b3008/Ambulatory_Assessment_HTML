                            Questionnaires can be a more feasible and efficient research method than in-depth
                            interviews. Questionnaires are a lot cheaper to conduct than in-person interviews, which
                            require paying interviewers for their time. They also save time, for both parties, as
                            customers can fill it quickly on their own time and employees don't have to take time out of
                            their days to sit in on interviews.

                            Lastly, questionnaires can capture a larger audience. While it would be impossible for a
                            large company with upwards of tens of thousands of customers to interview every single
                            customer in person, the same company could potentially get close to receiving feedback from
                            their entire customer base when using online questionnaires.
